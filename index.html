			I am passionate about security, the sea and sunny days. I enjoy writing code
			and finding smart solutions to difficult problems. I worked on web security
			projects, had some crypto classes and played with binaries and assembly. I 
			also used to be a teaching assistent for basic programming, which was a very 
			delightful role.
